# ENSA

<This repository contains the scripts used for the ENSA project.>

There are 4 main folders where the scripts reside: 
- genome_annotation
- orthologue finder
- motif_prediction
- rnaseq_analysis


<Genome annotation>

This folder has the scripts used for the *de novo* annotation of the genomes. 
- "softmak_genome.irl3.sh" Uses RepeatModeler and RepeatClassifier for masking genomes
- "braker2"

<orthologue finder>
This folder has the scripts used for the *de novo* annotation of the genomes. 
- "rbb.irl.v1.2.sh" Reciprocal best blast for retreiving potential orthologues and their promoter sequences
- "rbb.irl.vprot3.sh"
- "rbb.irl.vprot4.sh"
- "rbb.process.sh"
- "iqtree"

<motif_prediction> 
This folder has the scripts used for motif analysis. 

<rnaseq_analysis> 
This folder has the scripts used for analyzing RNAseq data.
